🌟 This week, I have brought my Excel dashboard practice to an end and now the interactive Sales Dashboard is ready! 🚀

So I required something to monitor some Knowing the vacant positions, the number of employees, and the qualifications of the workers and certain regions. 

That is what I have in mind:
- 📊 Most age group, Number of active employee, Social status and number, Number of jobs in companies, An employee inside and outside, Acquisition qualification, Most possessive qualifications, Departments and number of jobs, Gender dominance of jobs, Number of jobs.

- 🔍active_employees, department, business_travel,  Age Brackets filters are useful in providing perfect interaction with the data set.

- Top Categories & Segments which help manage the resources.


As a result of this project, I learned a great deal more about data visualization, and data and graphic interaction which are valuable skills for a data manager. 💼
